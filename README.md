# Finding the Best Playing 11 - IPL Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this analysis was to identify the best playing 11 for a cricket team based on player performance in the IPL dataset.

## Data Preparation
I used the IPL dataset containing player statistics and match details. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure data consistency.

## Player Selection Criteria
To determine the best playing 11, I considered the following performance metrics:
- Batting Average
- Strike Rate
- Bowling Average
- Economy Rate
- Wickets Taken
- Catches
- Stumps
- runouts etc.,

## Analysis Approach
1. Calculated a composite score for each player based on the above criteria.
2. Sorted players based on their composite scores.
3. Selected the top 11 players with the highest composite scores for the best playing 11.

## Conclusion
The analysis led to the identification of the best playing 11 based on their overall performance in batting, bowling and keeping. These players are expected to contribute significantly to the team's success in the IPL.
